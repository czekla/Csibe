We must get through that air shield! Say goodbye to your two best friends, and I don't mean your pals in the Winnebago.

They've encased him in Carbonite. He should be quite well protected. If he survived the freezing process, that is. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.
